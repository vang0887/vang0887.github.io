  <h1>Chong Vang</h1>

  <p>A lifetime of working with nuclear power has left me with a healthy green glow…and left me as impotent as a Nevada boxing commissioner.
    Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom. And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
    
    I didn't get rich by signing checks. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get. I was saying "Boo-urns. " I've had it with this school, Skinner.
    
    Jesus must be spinning in his grave!
    Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. D'oh. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.

    Here's to alcohol, the cause of — and solution to — all life's problems.
    Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me? I was saying "Boo-urns."
    
    Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
    We started out like Romeo and Juliet, but it ended up in tragedy.
    Mrs. Krabappel and Principal Skinner were in the closet making babies and I saw one of the babies and then the baby looked at me.
    Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Save me, Jeebus.
